<p>Ladan Jiracek interview</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Ulrich Hofmann</strong> - SECTION OF NEUROELECTRONIC SYSTEMS, Department of Neurosurgery, Freiburg. Was super nice, talked 4 hours, doesn&rsquo;t have money. Interesting research. He gave him a <strong>list of related labs in Evernote.</strong></p>
<h1>Neuroprosthetics replacing pharmaceuticals</h1>
<p>Ladan got more interested in: bioelectronics implants &ndash; in peripheral nervous systems to stimulate organs, can disrupt huge pharma, has lot of money in it. This is 5 years down the line, while brain implants are 10 yrs down the line.</p>

<p><strong>Britain</strong> &ndash; Imperial College London. &lsquo;Galvani&rsquo; startup.</p>
<p><strong>USA</strong> &ndash; Texas, NY &ndash; Feinstein Institute.</p>
